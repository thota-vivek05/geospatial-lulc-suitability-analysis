# Geospatial LULC Suitability Analysis Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning

![Final Suitability Map](results/LULC_Suitability_Map.png)

---

# Overview

This project integrates Remote Sensing, GIS, Spatial Analysis, and Machine Learning techniques to perform Land Use Land Cover (LULC) suitability analysis for the Medchal region.

The workflow includes satellite image preprocessing, spectral index generation, raster-based suitability modeling, proximity analysis, and machine learning-based spatial prediction.

An interactive web visualization platform was also developed for displaying suitability outputs and spatial layers.

# Spectral Indices Used

## NDVI — Normalized Difference Vegetation Index

Used for vegetation analysis and green cover extraction.

**NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)**

---

## NDBI — Normalized Difference Built-up Index

Used for built-up land identification.

**NDBI = (SWIR - NIR) / (SWIR + NIR)**

---

## NDWI — Normalized Difference Water Index

Used for water body extraction.

**NDWI = (Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)**

---

## SAVI — Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index

Used to minimize soil brightness effects.

**SAVI = ((NIR - Red) × (1 + L)) / (NIR + Red + L)**

---
# Machine Learning Component

## Scripts

- `train_random_forest_suitability.py`
- `train_multilayer_spatial_random_forest.py`

These scripts automate spatial suitability prediction and multilayer raster analysis workflows.
